Further options for research include conducting sentiment analysis on the reviews of apps to see if ad-supported free app reviews are more negative than paid apps.  There is also the possibility to do an experiment with 2 versions of the app, one free, ad-enabled, and one paid, without ads, to see which one brings more profit and in the future remove the less profitable app."
